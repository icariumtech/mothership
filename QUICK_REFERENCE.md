## Troubleshooting

**Players can't connect?**
- Verify they're on the same WiFi network
- Check that the server is running (look for "Starting development server...")
- Try turning off firewall temporarily: `sudo ufw disable` (re-enable after: `sudo ufw enable`)

**IP address changed?**
- Run `hostname -I` to get your current IP
- Or let the start script show it automatically

**Need more help?**
- See [NETWORK_ACCESS.md](NETWORK_ACCESS.md) for detailed troubleshooting
- See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for general setup

## Example Message to Send

Once players are connected, send them a test message from the GM Console:

```
ATTENTION CREW MEMBERS

Priority: NORMAL or HIGH for dramatic effect!
