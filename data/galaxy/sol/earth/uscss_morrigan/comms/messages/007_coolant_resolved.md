Captain,

Found the issue. Micro-fracture in the pressure regulator housing. Replaced the component from spares.

Pressure back to 742 PSI and holding steady.

Nothing to worry about - these regulators have a known failure rate after extended dock time. Should have caught it in pre-flight but the fracture was hairline.

All clear now. Back to normal rotation.
