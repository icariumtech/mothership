Commander,

Specimen analysis proceeding as scheduled. Latest batch shows
promising results for the regenerative compound synthesis.

Minor containment incident in Lab C resolved without casualties.
Recommend upgraded restraint protocols for Class-3 specimens.

Will have full report ready by end of week.
