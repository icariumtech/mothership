Dr. Chen,

Upgrade those containment protocols immediately. I don't like
the sound of "minor" incidents with Class-3 specimens.

Submit your full incident report by 0800 tomorrow. Include
detailed analysis of the containment failure and proposed
countermeasures.

Security will be conducting random lab inspections this week.
