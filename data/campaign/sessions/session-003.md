The crew rushed to Cargo Bay 3 to investigate the hull breach alarm. They found the bay in chaos—**cargo containers torn open from the inside**, their contents scattered across the deck. The breach itself was small, barely large enough for a human to fit through, but the surrounding bulkhead showed signs of extreme acid damage.

Security Officer Hayes swept the bay with thermal imaging and detected a heat signature in the ventilation system above. Before the crew could react, something large moved through the ductwork, heading toward the engineering section. Dr. Vasquez recognized the acid patterns from classified xenobiology reports she had only heard rumors about.

### Critical Developments
- Hull breach traced to biological entity
- Acid damage consistent with xenomorph species
- Entity relocated to engineering section
- Life support systems at risk

The crew now faces a containment crisis. Whatever was in that frozen lab is now loose on the ship, and they're trapped in deep space with it.
