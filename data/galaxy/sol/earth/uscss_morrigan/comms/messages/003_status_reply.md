Captain,

All systems nominal. Hyperdrive cores are primed and holding steady at 98.7% efficiency.

Ran diagnostics twice just to be sure. We're green across the board.

One minor note - coolant pressure in secondary manifold is slightly elevated. Nothing concerning, but I'll keep an eye on it during transit.
