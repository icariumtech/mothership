The crew ventured through the unauthorized hatch discovered in the previous session. Beyond the door lay a series of narrow maintenance corridors that weren't in the official blueprints. The air grew colder as they descended, and their motion trackers began displaying intermittent phantom signals.

Chief Engineer Torres identified the corridors as part of a **classified Weyland-Yutani retrofit**—modifications made to the Morrigan before its current mission. The crew found a small research lab containing biological containment units, most of them empty. One unit still had power, its contents obscured by frost. Dr. Vasquez warned against opening it without proper quarantine protocols.

The session ended with a hull breach alarm triggering in Cargo Bay 3—the same bay where the initial anomalies were detected.
