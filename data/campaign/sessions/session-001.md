## Session Recap

The crew emerged from cryosleep aboard the **USCSS Morrigan**, a commercial hauling vessel in deep space. The ship's AI, **CHARON**, had initiated an emergency wake protocol after detecting anomalous readings in Cargo Bay 3. Initial investigations revealed nothing unusual, but the crew noticed that several storage containers had been tampered with.

Dr. Elena Vasquez reported inconsistencies in the ship's medical logs—someone had accessed the cryobay systems during the voyage. Captain Morrison authorized a full security sweep of all decks. The session ended with the crew discovering a sealed maintenance hatch that wasn't on the original ship schematics.
